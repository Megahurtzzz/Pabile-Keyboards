Pabile Keyboards are Pro Micro based keyboards and macropads. These were designed to work with [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/) and tested with similar clones like NRFMICRO for [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/). Though tested, files shared here are my backups and may be a work in progress. Please take time to review before use. 

QMK configuration files were compiled using [vial-qmk](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk) fork for [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) compatibility. ZMK configuration files were written for [nrfmicro](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro).
