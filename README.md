Files shared here are my backups and are mostly work in progress. Please take time to review before use. 

QMK configuration files were design using [vial_qmk fork](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk). Vial compatibility will be lost if compiled elsewhere.

ZMK configuration files were designed with [joric's nrfmicro_13](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro).
